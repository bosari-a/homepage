# Personal Homepage website for CS50x PSET 8

![Front page of the website](assets/jstoast.png)

```sh
titor@IBN-5100:~/js-toast/homepage$ make greeting

./greeting

-> Hello World!

-> My name is JS-Toast nice to meet you!

-> This is my solution to the week 8 PSET in CS50x 2023

-> Well, mostly memes about CS50x

-> Feel free to have a look around!
```

I had so much fun making this website. I used
bootstrap v5.2 as it was a necessary part of the problem set however, a lot of the styling is my own `CSS`. This project would have not come out as nicely as I would have wished for it to be without some major inspiration and without the help of some assets and websites. Below I leave a link to the resources that helped me the most during development and to whatever inspired the layout of this page.

And finally, thanks for the existence of lorem ipsum placeholder text. Wouldn't know what to do without it.
